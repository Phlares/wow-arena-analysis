# Combat Parser Development & Optimization Log

## 🎯 Project Overview
Building an enhanced combat log parser for WoW Arena gameplay analysis that extracts precise performance metrics from terabytes of video data and corresponding combat logs.

## 📊 Data Landscape
- **Video Archive**: 11,355+ matches dating back to 2023
- **Combat Logs**: Available from January 2025 onwards only
- **Challenge**: Match videos to correct combat logs with precise timing

## 🔧 Key Development Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Timestamp Matching ✅
**Problem**: Original `parse_logs_fast.py` used unreliable timestamp matching with 5-10 minute errors.

**Solution**: Created `test_timestamp_matching.py` and enhanced matching system:
- **Method Detection**: Auto-detect new format (has 'start' field) vs old format (needs combat log parsing)
- **High Reliability**: JSON 'start' field (±30 second windows)
- **Medium Reliability**: Combat log parsing (±2 minute windows) 
- **Low Reliability**: Filename estimation (±5 minute windows)
- **Result**: 100% success rate on enhanced timestamp matching

**Key Files**:
- `improved_timestamp_matcher.py` - Core matching logic
- `master_index_enhanced.csv` - Output with precise timestamps and reliability scores

### Phase 2: Combat Log Format Analysis ✅
**Discovery**: Combat log timestamp format different than expected.

**Original Expected**: `M/DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff` (combined with filename date)
**Actual Format**: `M/D/YYYY HH:MM:SS.fff-Z` (full date with timezone)

**Fix**: Updated `parse_log_line_timestamp()` to handle:
```python
# Parse full timestamp: "1/2/2025 18:04:33.345-5"
timestamp_clean = full_timestamp.split('-')[0].strip()
result = datetime.strptime(timestamp_clean, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S.%f")
```

### Phase 3: Smart Arena Boundary Detection ✅
**Problem**: Parser was matching events from WRONG arena matches (previous/next matches).

**Root Cause**: Simple time window approach caught events from adjacent matches.

**Solution**: Implemented smart arena matching algorithm:

#### Algorithm Steps:
1. **Extract Expected Info** from filename:
   - `2025-01-01_20-21-29_-_Phlurbotomy_-_3v3_Ruins_of_Lordaeron_(Win).mp4`
   - Expected: `3v3` bracket on `Ruins of Lordaeron` map

2. **Collect Arena Events** in extended window (±10 minutes):
   - Find all `ARENA_MATCH_START` and `ARENA_MATCH_END` events
   - Parse zone IDs to map names (572 = Ruins of Lordaeron, 1825 = Hook Point, etc.)

3. **Smart Matching Strategy**:
   - **Strategy 1**: Look backward from video timestamp for most recent matching arena start
   - **Strategy 2**: If no backward match, look forward from video timestamp
   - **Validation**: Match both bracket (3v3) AND map name (Ruins of Lordaeron)

4. **Find Precise Boundaries**:
   - Once correct start found, find corresponding `ARENA_MATCH_END`
   - Use these EXACT boundaries for event counting

#### Zone ID Mapping (Complete):
```python
zone_map = {
    '980': "Tol'viron",
    '1552': "Ashamane's Fall", 
    '2759': "Cage of Carnage",
    '1504': "Black Rook",
    '2167': "Robodrome",
    '2563': "Nokhudon", 
    '1911': "Mugambala",
    '2373': "Empyrean Domain",
    '1134': "Tiger's Peak",
    '1505': "Nagrand",
    '1825': "Hook Point",
    '2509': "Maldraxxus",
    '572': "Ruins of Lordaeron",
    '617': "Dalaran Sewers",
    '2547': "Enigma Crucible"
}
```

## 🎯 Solo Shuffle Handling ✅
**Challenge**: Solo Shuffle behaves differently from standard arena:
- **6 Rounds**: Each round triggers `ARENA_MATCH_START` but no `ARENA_MATCH_END` between rounds
- **Single Session**: All 6 rounds played on same arena map
- **Different JSON Structure**: Contains `soloShuffleTimeline` with round-by-round results
- **Complex Scoring**: 3+ rounds won = overall win, <3 rounds = loss
- **Bracket Name**: `"Rated Solo Shuffle"` in combat logs vs `"Solo Shuffle"` in JSON

**Solution**:
1. **Enhanced Bracket Matching**: Handle `"Solo Shuffle"` ↔ `"Rated Solo Shuffle"` equivalence
2. **Session-Level Matching**: Match entire shuffle session instead of individual rounds
3. **Round Timeline Correlation**: Verify shuffle timeline against multiple `ARENA_MATCH_START` events
4. **Death Correlation**: Cross-verify deaths across all 6 rounds

### Phase 4: Enhanced Event Detection ✅
**Improvements Made**:

#### Pet vs Player Cast Separation:
- **Problem**: Pet casts counted as player casts
- **Solution**: Only count `src == player_name` for `cast_success_own`
- **Exception**: Track pet `Devour Magic` dispels separately as `purges_own`

#### Spell Tracking:
- **`spells_cast`**: Track which spells player cast (`"Shadow Bolt"`, `"Fear"`, etc.)
- **`spells_purged`**: Track which auras pet dispelled (`"Sun Sear"`, `"Blessing of Protection"`, etc.)

#### Purge Detection Fix:
- **Wrong**: Looking for `SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS` with `"Devour Magic"`
- **Correct**: Looking for `SPELL_DISPEL` events:
```python
if event_type == 'SPELL_DISPEL' and len(parts) >= 13:
    if pet_name and src == pet_name and spell_name == "Devour Magic":
        purged_aura = parts[12].strip('"')  # "Sun Sear"
        features['purges_own'] += 1
        features['spells_purged'].append(purged_aura)
```

#### Combat Log Event Structure:
- **SPELL_DISPEL**: `parts[12]` contains the aura that was purged
- **SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS**: `parts[10]` contains the spell that was cast
- **SPELL_INTERRUPT**: `parts[10]` contains the interrupt spell used

## 🐛 Debug Process ✅
Created `debug_enhanced_combat_parser_fixed.py` with extensive logging:
- **Phase 1**: Smart arena boundary detection with validation
- **Phase 2**: Event parsing within precise boundaries
- **Debug Output**: First 10 events of each type with timestamps
- **Validation**: Shows expected vs found arena info, spell lists

## 📈 Expected Metrics Tracked
```python
features = {
    'cast_success_own': 0,           # Player spells cast successfully
    'interrupt_success_own': 0,      # Interrupts you performed  
    'times_interrupted': 0,          # Times you were interrupted
    'precog_gained_own': 0,          # Precognition buffs you gained
    'precog_gained_enemy': 0,        # Precognition buffs enemies gained
    'purges_own': 0,                 # Auras your pet dispelled
    'spells_cast': [],               # List of spells you cast
    'spells_purged': []              # List of auras your pet purged
}
```

## 🚀 Phase 5: Production-Ready Version ✅
**Final Implementation**: Created `enhanced_combat_parser_production.py`

## 💡 Key Learnings
1. **Precision Matters**: 5-10 minute timestamp errors cause wrong arena matching
2. **Combat Log Structure**: Full date format, not time-only with filename date
3. **Arena Validation**: Must match both bracket type AND map name
4. **Event Types**: Different events have different field structures (SPELL_DISPEL vs SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS)
5. **Pet Handling**: Pets need special logic for casts vs purges vs interrupts
6. **Production Efficiency**: Progress tracking and error handling essential for large datasets
7. **Reliability-Based Processing**: Different strategies needed based on timestamp quality

## 🎯 Production Deployment

```bash
cd "E:/Footage/Footage/WoW - Warcraft Recorder/Wow Arena Matches"
