    friendly_team: TeamComposition
    enemy_team: TeamComposition
    arena_start_time: datetime
    arena_end_time: datetime

# Player Information Model  
@dataclass
class PlayerInfo:
    name: str
    class_name: str                 # Warlock, Priest, etc.
    specialization: str             # Affliction, Holy, etc.
    role: PlayerRole               # Tank/Healer/DPS (inferred)
    team: TeamSide                 # Friendly/Enemy (JSON-based)
```

### Performance Metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Coordination Scoring Algorithm

```python
# Role-based weighting system
for player in friendly_team.players:
    if player.role == PlayerRole.HEALER:
        player_weight = 1.0  # Healers enable kills via CC/healing
    else:
        player_weight = 2.0  # DPS focus fire is critical

# Coordination calculation per time window
coordination_score = coordination_weight / total_possible_weight

# Theoretical ranges for 3v3 (2 DPS + 1 Healer):
# Perfect (all attack same target): 5.0/5.0 = 1.000
# High (both DPS attack): 4.0/5.0 = 0.800  
# Medium (1 DPS + Healer): 3.0/5.0 = 0.600
# Low (1 DPS only): 2.0/5.0 = 0.400
```

### JSON Metadata Processing

```python
# Team detection using video metadata
for combatant in json_data['combatants']:
    if combatant['_teamID'] == primary_player_team_id:
        player.team = TeamSide.FRIENDLY
    else:
        player.team = TeamSide.ENEMY
    
    # Role inference from specialization ID
    spec_id = combatant['_specID']
    player.role = SPEC_ID_TO_ROLE.get(spec_id, PlayerRole.UNKNOWN)
```
